                We are aggregators of all things entrepreneurship – all sizes, all components are addressed by us. Icon Business Forum is an open-ended firm that attempts to nurture economic opportunities.  We feel that the best results are achieved when there is teamwork and teamwork happens when the results can possibly fulfil dreams for everyone in the team.
                <br><br>We feel that promoting start-ups and entrepreneurs can make a sizeable economic impact and makes great business sense. Thus, we promote start-ups through advising them, co-founding them, conducting events to promote them, providing training services, connecting them, sharing knowledge with them.  We have tried to set an example by mobilizing not only investors and service providers for start-ups but also engage a high-end ecosystem that make a business iconic – industrialists, CEOs, celebrities, media professionals, industry association leaders participate in our work.
                <br><br>Academic institutions, co-working spaces, organizers, consulting firms – a wide spectrum of partnering firms have helped us to undertake this journey.

                        There are only 3 rules to public speaking:<br>
1.	Speaking is an art to be practiced and not a science to be studied.<br>
2.	Pick up a model – observe the speech of someone who you like.<br>
3.	Once you have fixed someone as your role model, practice speaking and develop your style.<br>
4.	Expect extraordinary results in 10-15 days.

                            Today the biggest and most resourceful companies have seen their growth come to a standstill. 
New products are services are replacing the old ones in a very short span of time and this makes growth from existing businesses less likely.
If, suppose, your business is petrol, you can invest in a renewable energy startup to be assured of a pie if it grows or at the very least acquire rudimentary know-how of the business if it grows big.
By applying your administrative ability, great connections and minimum amounts of investment, an industrialist can make big companies out of small technology-driven startups. 
It is tough to change your existing business, so why not partner with a startup that brings in the requisite new technology and culture.
Done well, getting into a number of startups and enterprises, will get you a stake in the next generation of big companies.
As an industrialist, you know how to make a business big, so YOUR startup will grow bigger than that of other folks.

                           The era of a job being steady, taking care of your children , and your retirement is over. 
There was a time for decades where increased your company was big and as it got bigger or as your loyalty and experience increased, you received more benefits – this is not that era.
Technology is leading to phenomenally jobless growth. As companies grow, they prefer to automate their processes and ask people to leave or accept salary cuts or atleast do not accept the company to take care of you for your lifetime.
The economic slowdown, current human resources practices, leaves you with unfulfilling salaries. A startup, or a sidebusiness, can help you get that extra income.
Having a company of your own helps you get recognition which often does not come being an employee.
Good employers are encouraging employees to have their own businesses – it takes the pressure off them to be responsible for you in every way. 
The period between two jobs can be very long nowadays. It is thus a good safety net to have an additional business on which to fall back on for your basic needs.
It is good retirement planning. As you age, your startup will become more mature too. This will help you use your experience in running your business to pursue freelance income or a business.

It is a force of habit for an employer to write in their appointment letters that your new hire cannot pursue an additional source of income – this was good when your offered dream salaries.
Your employee expects you to pay you on time, give your increments even during tough economic slowdowns. Letting them do a startup or an additional source of freelance income will take the pressure of you. If done with a dose of friendliness, you could learn a new business from your employee who includes you in his business in return for your encouragement. Isn’t there a long list of employers who have partnered with their ex-employees to make big companies – the list does not stop at Mudra Communications that was started by Dhirubhai Ambani’s employee AG Krishnamurthy

Obviously, you would have heard of Mark Zuckerberg, who has carved out an example of a student entrepreneur. Seriously, elders don’t know how to handle the extraordinary intelligence of children.
People attain big, responsible positions at all age groups – those who start experiencing work earlier, get their big breaks earlier. You can start some businesses without any capital. You can bring in energy and an ability to connect with the world today and your can outsource maturity and management experience to your elders. The job market is not rosy at all. You already know this. Having a startup of your own will give you a source of income and also you having an experience at starting up will make your interviews a lot better.

If you are unemployable for some reason – the reason can be many including living in an isolated, protected world with no training to fit into society, there is some cheer here. 
Today there are grants from various sources available – this means money also goes into vehicles where there is no possibility of making anything back. Thus, having a startup of your own or in partnership gives you a medium to make money. 
Also, human beings are naturally born with an anxiety to help the helpless. Having a startup can help the very able ones let you have a piece of their abilities and start a new life.

You have done well all your life but can sense that all is not so well beneath the veneer – social unrest, floods, terrorist attacks, earthquake can completely wipe out your life at one go. 
If you have lost everything for some reason, startup is easier and less expensive than ever before. Your own startup can help you rebuild your life to the extent that matches your expectations from life.  Chances are, your ability will attract the investments too. 
If you are not satisfied with your business, you can start another one deploying other co-founders, partners, employees. With mobiles, emails etc., you can also look into your new business while holding on to the old one.

Inequality has come to the forefront as a major problem in the world – assets, businesses, investments are concentrated in the hands of the select few. Even though with great wealth comes great responsibility, it will be difficult to expect promoters to change this by suddenly raising salaries and giving better terms to vendors when businesses are on the edge. The most easy route to make an impact for them will perhaps be investing – Ratan Tata has been making investments regularly in the last one year. A firm, Dalit Industry Chamber of Commerce & industry (DICCI) obtains investments for dalit entrepreneurs from Tata companies and makes them vendors. 
Investments in startups can help the extremely wealthy in many ways – It puts them on a strong moral footing (one of the best ways to protect wealth) of creating much needed opportunities and also makes sure they remain wealthy over a period of time – after all, these companies will grow due to their influence and money and make even more wealth.

Wages have just refused to rise. Entrepreneurship thus has turned to be an option where a working professional is able to have enough immediate cash to meet needs and this ensures that upside in the business goes to him. Also, entrepreneurship and freelance opportunities are helping salaried people make additional income to make up for the lower salary levels.
